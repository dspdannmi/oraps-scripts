	- robust rollback and recovery plans in place



Capture:
	- invalid objects (including PDBs)
	- running databases
		- state of PDBs
		- DataGuard status
	- running listeners
		lsnrctl status for all

	- mounted filesystems
	- /etc/hosts
	- /etc/passwd

	- sudoers config
	- sshd config
	- ASM disk usage
	- recovery file dest usage
	- More than (>) 4Gb on / for updates
	- More than (>) 250Mb on /boot for updates
        - cron/crontabs

	- grid
		-alert logs

Do:
	- create in maintenance flagfile on server
	- update changelog with intended changes for today
	- capture:  dspcli serverinfo -basic


DURING
======
	- make a note of any temporary changes or anything temporary created to be removed
	- afterwards

	- update NOTAMs and change log as you go


AFTER
=====

Check:
	- filesystem space
	- users exist
	- groups exist
	- invalid objects
	- mounted filesystems including NFS
		- if CIFS dont mokunt could be because FIPS is enabled
	- sshd config
	- ASM disk usage
	- recovery file dest usage
	- PDBs are in same staate
	- dataguard status
	- charactersets
	- alert log errors
	- /var/log/messages errors
	- cron / crontabs / cron.allow <---- new VM such as DB system OL7->OL8 upgrade
	- check /etc/oracle-release / uname -a is expected
	- check version and patch-levels of database as expected
	- check version and patch-levels of GI/ASM are as expected
	- check UIM monitoring is now showing any alerts
	- send comms that works are complete


Do:
	- post-work checks of backups etc.
	- check monitoring is re-established and no alerts
	- sanity reboot performed
	- update changelog with confirmation of changes and any deviation
	- capture: dspcli serverinfo -basic
	- confirm works are complete
	- check backups have run successfully
	- remove maintenance on servers if finish early
        - cycle the alert log prior to monitoring resuming

Do some days after:
	- check backups
	- remove temproary objects
	

Need the ability to save off start after finished works to be able to answer questiions 6 months from now "Look, when I left, backups were running"
