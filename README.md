This bundle of scripts is intended to be used by DSP employees and partners.
It contains scripts for OS, database and middleware.

This bundle is maintained by the Oracle Professional Services team within DSP.
Please see above for contact details.

Primary contributors/maintainers:
	Adeem Mir		(adeem.mir@dsp.co.uk)
	Carl Hewkin		(carl.hewkin@dsp.co.uk)
	George Dickson		(george.dickson@dsp.co.uk)

There will be scripts and resources within this bundle that have been taken
from various sources.  Not all scripts and resources have been created by 
the OraPS team though that is the case for the majority.  Where possible,
creators should and will have been credited.  Only scripts and resources
that have been taken from external sources and websites will have done so
on the belief and understanding they were open source.  Please inform the
OraPS team if you believe this has been contravened and we will take immediate
action to remove (and if appropriate replace with in-house developed) from
subsequent releases.
