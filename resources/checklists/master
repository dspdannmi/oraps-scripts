capture information about the server BEFORE works
- what is THIS server
	- physical / virtual /
	- Oracle Engineered System (ie. creating / managing a DB on Exa or ODA is different than a "standard" server
		- /opt/oracle/dcs  (base system or oda etc?)
		- odacli?
		- dcs agent running

	- time and time zone
- GI
	- alert log for erros

	- alert log for erros
	- what state are the DG standby databases in
	- what time is the database in:
		- when you connect directory from the server (ie. sqlplus / as sysdba)
		- when you connect via Oracle*Net (this can be different in an ASM/GI environment when connectiving via listener and also, with this type of env and also ODAs etc, can set differently depending on the db etc.




Public IP addresses
	- use reserved IP addresses for those IP address that would cause a problem if they change (eg. LBs)

Load Balancer

		- is there actually anything listening on the port at the backend
		- firewalld
		- SE linux

- backup:
	/etc
	/var
	/opt
	/home
	/root

        eg. cd/
	tar zcvf ...../backup.YYYYMMDD/etc.tar.gz etc

	or if space is premium run gzip -9

		tar cvf - etc | gzip -9 > ......./backup.YYYYMMDD/etc.tar.gz

- $ORACLE_HOME/dbs
- $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin

- database spfiles

- have databases been backed up off server

- capture info (capture.sh)
